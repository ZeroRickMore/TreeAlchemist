 Ever thought of implementing an Attack Defense Tree into the Open-Source Wazuh? This tool is a perfect suit for you. Give an xml written ADT, a xml written defenses file, and a map between defense and ADT nodes in input, and get the fully converted tree into Wazuh-ready rules, including Active Responses too, with an intuitive syntax strongly based off Wazuh's syntaxes.
