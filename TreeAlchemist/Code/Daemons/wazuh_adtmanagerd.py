'''
Script to handle the defense launch, based off the current ADT state.

It uses the same State and Tree classes used in TreeAlchemist,
and maps each agent to a list of states based on the ADT.
Realistically, it is a dictionary from {ADT_id (int) : state (list[int])

This manager gets the alerts raised from syslog

The folder Trees contains a set of text files that help recreate the tree and nodes very simply.
They are automatically generated by ADT-Generator

Tree:
[100017, 100018...] # The id of the nodes, no matter the order
States:
[100017]=Def1
[100018]=Def2
[100017,100018]=Def3


General idea:
An alert is raised on Wazuh, and delivered to rsyslog, specifically on the file tree_alchemized_alerts.log
as specified in rsyslog config.

A tool watches the log file, and gathers the informations about the file modifications.
Each line of the log contains an alert, and the only important sections are the rule ID, the Tree name, and the Agent that raised the alert.

This daemon updates the tree state (there is a dictionary containing Agent name, with value another dict mapping a Tree Name to a list, the list being the state)


Please note that this version is Linux-specific, as it uses system calls.
