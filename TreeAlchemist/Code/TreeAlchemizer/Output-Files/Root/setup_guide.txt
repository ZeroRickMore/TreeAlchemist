Hello, and welcome to the TreeAlchemist guide!
This is an extremely short text to guide you through the utilization of the generated files.



Rules File: [ 100010-TreeAlchemized-Root.xml ] =======================

	- Go into /var/ossec/etc/rules/
	- Move the rules file 
		[ z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\100010-TreeAlchemized-Root.xml ]
	 inside of it, and job done!

Else, just copy these commands:

	sudo su
	cp z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\100010-TreeAlchemized-Root.xml /var/ossec/etc/rules



Defenses File: [ defenses-Root.xml ] =======================

	- Modify content of /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
	- Copypaste all of the content of 
		[ z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\defenses-Root.xml ]
	 inside of it, at the very end, and job done!



Athanor File: [ Root_athanor.txt ]=======================

	- Go into the directory where the daemon reads file from.
	It is the "Trees" directory located where Athanor.py is located.
	If you did not touch the github code, it is inside /TreeAlchemist/Code/Daemons/ .
	- Move 
		[ z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\Root_athanor.txt ]
	 inside of it.

So, commands for an untouched github folder:

	cp z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\Root_athanor.txt z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\Root_athanor.txt


===[ DO NOT FORGET ]===

Place the defensive scripts inside of the watched hosts (NOT THE WAZUH SERVER) in /var/ossec/active-response/bin !!!

The name of the script MUST be what you find inside of each <executable> in the file
	[ z:\GitHub\TreeAlchemist\TreeAlchemist\Code\TreeAlchemizer\Output-Files\Root\defenses-Root.xml ]
plus a file extension if you did not declare it in the tag!!
REMEMBER to change permissions of the scripts with these commands:

	sudo chmod 750 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/your_script_name.extension
	sudo chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/active-response/bin/your_script_name.extension

In the end, doing [ls -l] should show same permissions for each script.
ALSO DO NOT FORGET TO sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager !!!
Else the changes will have no impact.


I hope everything worked for you!
Have fun with your tree, and do not forget to launch the daemon in order to make the tree handling functional!
